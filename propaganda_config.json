    "text_prompt": "A bold, vintage propaganda poster in the style of early to mid-20th century political posters, with a textured paper background and a limited color palette of deep red, beige, and tan. Central focus on a stylized figure from either CS:GO (S.A.S. character with gas mask and tactical gear) rendered in a bold, simplified, stencil-style silhouette. Behind the character, rays or geometric patterns emanate like a nazi propaganda banner, reinforcing the dramatic, heroic tone. Below the character, in large, bold, all-caps type, the text reads 'PLAY CS2' in a striking, propaganda-style font. The text must be legible, clean, and the dominant element of the lower half of the poster. Do not obscure or distort the words. The phrase 'PLAY CS2' must be perfectly clear and prominent. Design should closely follow the aesthetic and tone of historical propaganda, using strong lines, symmetrical layout, and nationalistic or militant symbolism. Poster should feel intense, dramatic, and action-invoking.",
